# IsingModelBoltzmannMachine
Using Monte-Carlo simulated datasets, a completely transparent Boltzmann Machine trained on 1-D Ising chain data is implemented to predict model couplers in the absence of past coupler values. Methods from machine learning applied to theoretical physics are on display in this work.
